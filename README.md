# product-landing-page
This is a FCC project that I have been working on with all current knowledge of web design, HTML, and CSS.
This does not utilize bootstrap or anything else to make it look more modern or pretty. 
I decided to use github for the first time to see what it would be like working in a real coding enviroment and using git hub for version control rather than the codepen site they allow us to use.

cheers.
